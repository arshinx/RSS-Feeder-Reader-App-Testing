# Feed Reader Testing â€” Test Driven Development (TDD)

## Background
Using Jasmine (framework) to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application in order to test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## Motivation
Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!
